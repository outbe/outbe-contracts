# Consumption Unit

Consumption Unit is a non-transferable non-fungible cryptographically secure and auditable token
that represents a proof of consumption made by a user and 
serves as inputs to the networkâ€™s Proof of Consumption logic 
and underpin token issuance and reward participants. 

Consumption Units creation is a responsibility of a separate actor "Consumption Unit Agent" that
signs each consumption unit and pushes to the network.

_NB: at the moment anyone could create consumption units for testing purpose i.e. no mint restrictions_

Consumption unit is implemented in a way of smart contract and below is described logic how to deal with it.

## Consumption Unit Creation

Creating of the consumption unit is a "mint" operation. 
For minting a consumption unit the following data is required:
- "token_id" the consumption unit identifier, should be unique.
- "owner" a user address that this consumption belongs to.
- "entity" the consumption unit entity i.e. payload info.
- "digest" a cryptographical digest of the entity in sha256 hash hex.

To create a valid digest you need to serialize the given entity as a binary json in
[json binary](https://github.com/CosmWasm/serde-json-wasm)
and then sign the given bytes using `sha256` hash function and encode in hex format.
